a) A random woman is NOT your matter of discussion. Whatever she thinks, whoever she likes, none of your concern. Stay out of it. She doesn't do it to please you, and that shouldn't be hurting your pride. 
b) Even if related, you have no authority to control what she feels or who she likes. Let a woman prosper in her dreams and goals, cherish her, add to her greatness, but do not, in any way, think that you own her.
c) Just because she doesn't like you enough to go out with you, nowhere in the world does it say that it gives you a free pass to comment and poke fun at the types of guys she likes or hangs out with. Doesn't make you look cool, dude, you're just being a jerk. Stop it.
d) Please stop, think for a moment, and realize just how terribly wrong you are when you are trying to bring a woman down for your own disgusting definition of ""fun"". You're not just ruining her confidence at speaking up, you're killing the society's chance of diminishing evil, you're ruining generations; your very own. How utterly foolish of you.

I hope we learn to see the bigger picture. It's 2018, yaar. Let Pakistan grow into the beautiful country that it very rightfully deserves to be!","If you're lost, continue wandering. Don't stop.

2018/12/08 10:17:50 PM GMT+5,k163968@nu.edu.pk,Student,Anusha Shermeen Ahmed,21,Female,3,4,3,1,5,3,3,3,5,5,"Before 13, I was a girl with no goals of becoming anyone's favorite, I didn't have any knowledge on how to look attractive. I would attend weddings and feel pretty by just wearing my mom's lipstick and a pretty dress, and my hair down. The definition of beauty to me back then was keeping myself clean and taking care of hygiene. I'd take a shower and the next minute, I'd be feeling like a Goddamn Queen, but you see, that was before 13. I was introduced to different levels and stages of attractiveness. I was so confused that I'd copy every 'ideal' girl in my class that every boy would respect and talk to, only to end up looking like a disaster.
14 was not easy; I had to be sure that my skin wouldn't turn too brown because I hated all those advice and comments from random aunties at weddings telling me how to turn white. I was introduced to perfect body shapes when girls in my class would compliment each other for having curves and flat stomach; let's be honest, I had neither of those qualities. I was chubby, and not curvy for sure. I loved to stay healthy because that's what my mom told me to be, ""being beautiful is being healthy and strong"", of course it was only because she wanted me to finish what was on the plate but the world outside was different.
At 15 I was told to stay behind the lens when it was my turn to explain my project in a carnival festival because the moderator had to look appealing to the audience.
At 16, I started using social media more frequently, and I would see people judging other people, questioning their fame because to them, such faces weren't fit for popularity, and I'd see, those faces were just like mine. 
At 17, my mom started worrying more about my skin tone and how those relatives would scold her again for not looking after me and my skin. She'd use different products on my face, lots of products, facials and cleansing and whatnot, and would be satisfied if the slightest indication of lighter skin color would start to show but it was all temporary because my real skin tone would always return. I'd never go in the sun, I'd avoid pools, seaside, and any place that would give a lot of exposure to the sunlight.
At 18, I entered university, and tried changing my style, the way of living overall because 'university girls should be mature, decent, elegant and sensible when it comes to fashion'.
I tried transforming, decided to not act myself but like all the girls that were pretty and pretty popular. Even bought expensive makeup but couldn't exactly learn how to make my nose look thinner and my face look smaller and less 'chubby'.
I'm 21 today and when I look back, I have nothing but regrets and guilt on how I spent 7 years of my life trying to become like every other girl people would call pretty or beautiful. How my mom succumbed to those comments of people who would hardly show up when she would need them.
I have recently found positivity and when I say ""found"", I mean I have gone back to the days where my own happiness mattered more than my weight and skin color. There are some days where I feel bad about so many things I cannot be and I can never promise to never feel that way but I'm glad it's always temporary now.
I never was comfortable with posing and letting anyone take my pictures because I was always scared to see what everyone could already see and seem to dislike but with the recent change, I have started to overcome this fear as well. I know my angle and I know my smile and I think I love it. 
I have started acting real, to you it can be strange sometimes but I swear it feels good. Take my advice, stop being what you cannot afford to be for the rest of your life, emotionally and mentally. Get out of character and praise everything you see, it's completely harmless, 100% recommended.","When I see those ""comment your name below, I'll tell you what I think about you"" posts, trust me I wanna know but also I don't because I am too scared you'll tell me something I know already but don't wanna believe.",I hate it when you're mad at someone and they apologize.,"I came across the terrible news of Rushaan Farukh's suicide, and it's upsetting how we're losing people this way. I have no idea what she was going through and I'm sure the people close to her didn't as well. Let's not say, ""she could have talked or spoken up"", we all know she must have done that a hundred times. Some people don't really know how to make the other person realize that their words and actions are hurting them. They show their disappointment and disagreement through anger or tears but unfortunately we call it ""seeking attention"" or ""over dramatic"" and ""over sensitive"". I personally believe that we don't know how to exactly express our sympathy. I know most of us don't mean the words we say but we STILL let those words get to the other person, and they don't focus on what you mean but what you just said. I don't like this world. I don't like how we are willing to kill someone's happiness and live peacefully afterwards. I know how it's like to constantly carry yourself around people who judge you on small things and pretend to be your friend. There was a time when I decided to end my life, and I have tried doing it thrice, but I couldn't because I'm not strong enough yet. I would name some people who are still in my friends list who contributed their efforts to make me feel horrible and non-worthy.
""Why do you cry so much? Need attention?""
""yaar aisa bhi kuch nai Hua, Har baat pe roti rehti ho""
""I am regretting being your friend""
""You're a liar, you don't deserve to be loved, I wish I could erase my past that I shared with you""
And more. Let me tell you one thing, I don't know and I don't really care what you are capable of and what power you possess, all I care about is the human inside of you that needs to come alive because it's enough now. I don't want sympathy and none of the people who ended their lives needed sympathy, they needed to be treated like you want to be treated. We all have a heart and you know it takes things seriously, so when you make someone your friend, understand their weaknesses and strengths, understand what makes them feel bad and what makes them feel strong, understand what comments make them cry and what comments make them laugh and when you've noticed everything, refrain from doing anything that you know would end up making them isolate themselves and struggle alone.
If you ever want to end your life, know that this world will never stop complaining about you even when you're not here. There will always be, ""oh she was nice but she did some things that weren't right but rest in peace"" and this is the truth, trust me.
You come to me. We will go out, I'll cure you, no matter how wounded you are, no matter how hurt you are, I will give my everything to get you out and I know some beautiful people who would do the same. If you take that step, there are 10 more people lined up behind you who are looking for motivation, don't be the negative motivation. We cannot change the way people think about you, but we can change how we deal with their bitterness. It's not an easy process but I'm willing to help you and I hope you're willing to help me too.
The minute you cut your veins, swallow poison, throw yourself off from the roof or a bridge, or hang yourself, that's when you realize it's too late and you wish you could think this through one more time. Don't die with regrets. Don't die.","Years of demanding perfection and flawlessness, let's embrace the imperfections and weaknesses that are the features, today.

It's okay if you stutter. Someone out there, someone like me, finds it cute.
It's okay if you still need your fingers to count on. 
It's okay if you struggle to get the perfect contour.
It's okay if you still need your mom to ask the shopkeeper about the price.
It's alright if you haven't lost enough weight.
It's okay if you're not tall enough, you're adorable with that height. 
It's okay if your crush doesn't notice you, seriously, look around, everyone notices you.
It doesn't matter if you don't know how to start a conversation, you're not alone. 
It's okay if you cannot walk in heels.
It's alright if you're struggling to tie your tie perfectly. 
It's fine if you're clumsy, I am too. 
It's okay if your partner has a better fashion sense than you, you may have a better sense of humor, and that's one of the major things that attract people, trust me. 
It's okay if you don't have enough money to treat your friends, you'll treat them bigger than their expectations one day.
It's okay if you didn't score well this time, we both know this isn't the end.
It's okay if you're shy in class, EVEN IF YOU'RE A BOY. 
It's okay if little things make you cry, especially when you're a BOY. You've got a heart, let it out.
It's okay if you don't feel comfortable wearing all the makeup and it's okay if you don't feel comfortable without all the glitters.
The marks your spectacles leave on your nose, they're okay too.

All the things I've mentioned above, they might be your weakness but certainly not flaws. They're your features that make you standout. It's an ongoing process which might be slow but you'll get there when you're supposed to. I honestly have most of these features and it took me years to understand that not everything happens when you want them to happen, but when you're ready, you'll see it coming and you won't have to worry about going back and learning it all over again because you're perfect now, and you were perfect then. We all are just fine with whatever feature we have, I love them. Let's love them together.","When the person you hate posts a hilarious meme, that's when you really learn how to stop yourself from reacting (literally).","I remember the time when Infinity War came out and everyone was so excited, but I wasn't amazed because I hated superhero movies. I hated Iron man and every other superhero that ever existed. But when I realized that I was actually the only one who hadn't watched IW, I felt left out, because everyone would be writing reviews, talking about stones and Thanos, and I wasn't able to contribute because I was 'marvel dumb'. That's when I decided to at least try understanding the concept of all these creations. So, I too, dived in. And I watched 13 movies in 4 days to watch the last show of IW in cinema. And since then, I've been a fan of superheroes. 
The one with an iron suit.
The one with a hammer.
The one with a shield.
The one with anger.
The one with spider instincts.
The one with claws.
The one with a sword.
The chemistry and understanding they all shared.
If it wasn't for superheroes, I would have never thought of thousands of other ways to save the universe.
If it wasn't for marvel, I wouldn't have understood the power of unity and what it can do when all the powers are united.
The various ways to save the planet. 
If it wasn't for you, Sir Stan Lee, we all wouldn't have been labeled as a family.
I love this family, and I love you for creating it in the first place.
You might be gone, but you'll live forever in our hearts just like all the superheroes you created.
I wish you had lived to play a role in Pakistani superhero marvel movie, but I understand you had to go. Rest in peace, legend. ‚ù§Ô∏è","Life of an 'over-thinker'

Life's good. It's revolving around positivity, you're doing well but you don't prefer peace too often. Your mind goes back to the afternoon of October, 2017, when you could have said so much but you didn't even stutter.

When you're feeling so broken that you end up texting people you decided to never talk to, and further breaking your own heart when they don't say anything other than just a ""yes?"". You assume they don't wanna talk, and you start regretting it. You assume they hate you and you start convincing yourself that it's the truth. 

When you keep replaying the same old scene when everyone who said they trust you turned their backs on you.

And the time when you let someone mentally torture you and emotionally abuse you, and thinking they can because you value them.

And the question, the complicated answers and subtle hints you could have noticed and walked away before the disaster shattered you.

When you let someone point out your flaws and believing the disgust that appears on their faces.

When you broke your mother's heart for someone who never really was yours, or anyone's.

You end up creating a mess with your mood.

You end up isolating yourself.

You end up creating scenarios in your head which you may or may not want to become reality. You start living in those assumptions, imagination and keep thinking about it over and over again until you completely lose your mind. Always expecting the worst. 

Some people might act like they have all the happiness in the world and the smile on their face may make you wish you had a life like theirs but trust me, what's on display is often never on the inside. If you find someone acting different, or texting you after months of separation, try getting out of character for a while and talk, not to go back, but to help them get out.",What's the name of the disease that makes you forget everything you've learned the minute you're given the question paper?,"Current situation: Trying my level best to not say ""you too"" to people wishing me birthday.","Never be friends with people your momma hates.

Good looking, tall but not so rich
Tall, rich, but average looking.

Confident, rejection, depression.

Society, corrupt, selective.
Originality, neglect, complex.

Everybody loves contrast, but not when skin color is involved.
Everyone likes to appreciate inner beauty but only loves the outside.
You can never be too perfect for 7.53 billion people. Everyone has a different definition for perfection; so will you change yourself billions of times to define flawlessness? I know it gets hard to survive when you go unnoticed when you're surrounded by people who keep up with the standard set by the people themselves, especially when what you offer is far better from what beauty can't, but don't let the levels and ranks take away your belief in ingenuity and its power. You cannot be gold and silver at the same time but you can be one of them, and you know what your worth is.

When the guy was asked to leave the girl alone by a group of other boys, he grabbed her by the arm to take her somewhere else, and she did.

The way I found myself lost in your universe,
Through the escalator of words that cascaded upon each other,

To guide through the portals of multiple parallel worlds,
With free servings of tropical emotions that were captured in a picture,

Found in an old abandoned house under raining sky,
That waited for the silver lining or the rainbow,

Or not because the picture the house had, Encapsulated all that was needed,

And it was complete.
Everything in nothingness that gave solace,
To the diminishing expectations of falling deeper,

And then not falling but just floating with a constant velocity,
While traveling in the dark to never find the one thing;
A cornerstone. ~Careasoul","Innocence once asked Sadness,
Where he'd lost his smile.
Sadness warned innocence of the world's cruelty.
Innocence bought it not at all.
Innocence probed Fire,
Where'd he lose his calm.

Chirping Innocence's outer wall.
Innocence looked for Hope.
Came across Depression walking deep in the sea.

Innocence cracked and went on to Love,
Found it under Hatred's veiled lies. ""Don't you envy Love so much?‚Äù The Hatred, in return, wrapped Innocence in cloaks of Fear

Today, Imran Khan has won from NA-243, and 5 of the votes he received were from me and my family. I wanted to be a part of the free and fair election, so I became a polling agent and witnessed first-hand how flawed and outdated our electoral process is. It needs immediate changes if we are to bring absolute transparency. 

To all the PTI supporters in my friendlist, hearty congratulations on achieving your goal! Your leader's struggle finally bore fruit, it might be a Naya Pakistan for you, but it'll be a Naya Pakistan for me and in reality when things start changing. I'm not saying Karachi should be New York City by tomorrow and that we'll be sending explorers to Mars by the end of August, but I'm willing to wait.

A book is not enough. Books end. And once the book has ended, you cannot re-read one chapter, one sentence, one word, because it‚Äôs over. The memory starts vanishing, the image starts blurring.

His pulse was 80 beats per minute, his arms and legs were in perfect shape and his brain was active. But the boy, for all intents and purposes, was dead.

Dreams created while experiencing a wistful fantasy were discarded long ago. Happiness has been excluded from his dictionary since ages. Peace is an alien concept , never achieved and only sought after by the mad. 

This state is limbo. The condition where you're desperately stuck and unable to escape. This state is interstice. The situation where you think the destination is nearing, but it never arrives. This state is purgatory.

Let me tell you, reading urdu novels is one of the BEST thing that can happen to anyonee!! (Atleast for me it is) 
It might seem hard at first to read this much urdu (kyunke hum sab tou angrez hain) but it's not impossible. 
Trust me when I say that urdu novels have such an underlying beauty that cannot be matched with any other.
It was no doubt a very lengthy novel, but it was worth everyyy single second! Took me 18 days (most of my semster break) to complete it, but I am very glad that I read it. 
I loved the way author has shown the uglier, darker and evil side of this society, how powerful and wealthy people can do anything they want to do with the public and get away with it easily in this country, but karma hits you back. :3
With money you may buy people, witnesses, jury and you may hide your bad deeds, but you can never hide these things from Allah. 
You legit pay back for every single thing that you sow. You pay back for every bruise you give to someone, you pay back for all the harsh things you say to someone, you pay back for every persons' life or family you ruin!
One thing which was greatly emphasized upon was killing a person may seem very easy to us. Khali aik gun chala ke insan ke jisam se goli hei tou aar paar krni hotti hai? No! When you kill a person, you lose a part of yourself. And that lost part is never retrieved. That part is buried forever with the person you killed. The guilt of taking a person's life is so huge and heavy that it seeps through your soul and stays with you and haunts you for the rest of your life. 
And also inteqam ka safar kabhi khatam nai hotta. Once it starts, it will keep going round and round from one generation to another. It is a never ending cycle. 
Hum sab ko apnay amaal krnay se pehlay allah ki pakar se darna chahiye kyunke insan kitni hei koshish kyun na krle bachnay ki, allah insaf krnay wala hai.
Ps. I LOVEDDD THIS NOVEL AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE!","Losing a dream is like losing a part of your soul but people still have this part of their heart latched to the lost part of their souls. I lost a part when I realised that the thing I dreamt about can never mine. I still mourn over it, I get depressed over it and I still sometimes dream of it but I guess this is the reality now and this is how it was supposed to end//
This is the magic of life. It throws rocks at you, you get hurt, you get bruised but it depends on you how you deal with those bruises. Either you heal them and start a new beginning or you hold on to those pieces forever and never move on?","I was thinking to write on this topic today since it was bothering me so much to see people making fun of this serious issue, but my sister wrote it better. So copying her status, here it is.

Only a few days after the bluewhale game awareness on social media, memes related to it have emerged. These memes try to lighten the subject of this game from all different aspects bringing phuppo and drawing skills and exams and what not into the jokes.
I request everyone to not share such memes and not even react to them (as it'll boost up their likes).
This game is the cause of so many suicides and that too of children. 
Suicide and death is NOT a thing to be taken lightly. It just doesn't seem appropriate to joke around with such subject.

it is not necessary to joke about everything","Okay. So I took out this video game out my drawer after 2 freakin' yearss! And then something struck me hard. I realized how much life has changed for me over the past 2 years. How much life has become worse (and maybe good) since I got into college. 
Life was so much easier when I left school. I went on an amazing vacation with family in summers. I thought I am going to one of the best colleges. These two years are going to be so amazing. But I didn't know I was wrong. These two years have been the most difficult years. Yet I learned alot of things, that I am glad I got a chance to. Tho I found a pretty decent set of friends, but in the hard times you realize most of them are not really there for you when you desperately need them.
Moving on, studies became harder than I imagined, college became (kind of) a torture, my dark circles became darker and deeper, and I finally I came on constant medications. And I never knew I'll become addicted to these meds. 
Coming back to the point, I never got the chance to enjoy my life in these past two years. Although I've been on numerous outings but I never really enjoyed my life to the fullest. I became so indulged coping up with life and grades that I never, even once felt the need to play video games and relax myself a bit. (Tho I used to and I still love video games). I hope since I am gonna start a totally new phase of life, I will enjoy these 4-5 years of university so that I don't regret it when I get old.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It shouldn't take some Netflix series and novels to make you realize what impact words (and even online behavior) can have.","Each of us is trying to fit in our own ways. Behind these screens, you and I are no different.","I keep coming back to look at this picture. Despite the photographer's amazing job with lighting and colors, what bothers me the most is my dull appearance. To you or someone else I might look fine, but to myself or people that have known me for a long time I look extremely dull and weak. 

This is not an attention seeking post, I merely want to communicate something I learned in the past year or two. (long post)

My life after graduation has been a very bumpy journey. From unemployment, to accepting realities of living in a brown society, and letting go of my dreams I realized a lot of things. Not getting a job, not being able to fund higher education, not finding a good partner to spend life with, not being in good health.. All these things overwhelmed me, they scared me and I felt powerless over my life. But I had no control over my fate or what was written for me anyway. I soon realized that the depression in my life stemmed not from lacking those ""accomplishments"" but rather from the people I had been with. That's the only thing you CAN control, the people you surround yourself with.

We read posts about ""toxic"" people every now and then, but let me tell you, from personal experience that it is no joke. They don't do something dramatic like villains from a movie. They're just ""friends"" who try to use you for their own good. They stick around because they see something for themselves in you. Unfortunately, some of the people I treated like my second family turned out to be just that. I had many mutual friends who I turned to for advice and help. But they either remained silent or made me feel like I was at fault. Among misunderstandings and bad confrontations I lost many friends. Yet I kept going back to them, I kept feeding myself consolations that they cared about me and ""doston mai tou ye chalta hai"". As much as I let them give me anxiety and stress I did not want to cut off the bonds because I was afraid to be alone. No one wants to feel alone. But my delusions blinded me. My weight dropped lower than 38kg, I started having inexplicable pains and what not. After some events that felt like a slap to my face, I finally learned a few things: 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Ô∏èIf you find yourself comparing yourself to people in your group, your friends re-evaluate your ""friendship"". There is no competition in good friends, only encouragement and happiness over each others success. You might be harming both, your friend and yourself. 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ô∏èSomeone who is shitty to you it is very likely they might be good to others, and if your mutual friends remain silent over it despite knowing everything, they're not your well wishers. You can keep in touch with them but never expect anything good from them either. 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Ô∏èDon't settle for less. Don't go below the standards you have set for yourself. Don't fall for the ""you waste opportunities"" argument. You have a right to say yes or no to what comes your way based on YOUR circumstances. That's how life works. 
4Ô∏è‚É£ Ô∏èEverything in life is insignificant. Life dies out like burning candles in a windy field, yours might blow out any moment. Don't worry about earning well, finding fairytale love, collecting degrees for the sake of it. Don't give in to this world's definition of ""success"". Pay more attention to your soul and ponder over existence itself. 
5Ô∏è‚É£ Ô∏èFigure out who your real well wishers are. Tbh your parents, and your siblings are the only ones who deserve your unconditional love and care. NO ONE else. 
6Ô∏è‚É£ Ô∏èDon't let bad experiences make you bitter, give people the benefit of doubt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sometimes you'll feel just like a rock sitting at the bottom of a lake, impotent, only to surface once the water dries; sometimes, you are the wall holding on to the water, which may very well result in a plague.

these are just 'some' of the times, life must go on and so will it for you.

- stay strong","have you ever been so lost that you feel like others can define 'you' better than you, yourself, these days?

how do I differentiate between ""what I need"" and ""what I want""? and is it selfish to want?","you are all amazing people, all the lot of you. you've been through things others won't understand, you've overcome them and here you stand. you're the best version of you, today!

with the last of the blood tears plucked, you ascend. with every step you mount, you quiver, you quaver. maybe, because you can almost feel the voices the sight bequeaths. though, you are certain they are pure, the voices that, now, scuttle through your ear

your tramps have now become trudges, as you finally feel the narrowest of the day stars shines caress your drudged fingers ... and, and as your wild orbs gypsy around, you realize the colors have drained out. fake, everything was. 

what do you do? ...","the governments are being heavily censured by about 190 million people of Pakistan on account of the Kalabagh Dam

the truth is, less than 2% of our 58 million strong employed population deserves a right to call out that censure.

the rest of us ? they are just as fraudulent as the Nawaz Sharifs and the Zardaris of our politics.","I have seen people drop disgustingly low to rise excessively high. i have seen those people gain respect, but never regain.

- I have seen humans in their natural guise.","23rd March. Just another day in the modern history of Pakistan.

You see, I left home early in the morning. It being a holiday, and a national one, we decided to go with the all national breakfast that is Halwa Puri. Exhaustive can waiting in queues be, but at least we have the decency to apply the first come, first served rule at our sovereign domains. All took guard of their places except this one lad who thought since he arrived there on a Rover, he need not be assumed equal. Broke the queue, got the order; went away, and went with him all the Equality as inscribed in our constitution(s).

On the way back, we stopped at the sight of a red signal, just like any of you ever did or will. We, Pakistanis, have a thing against traffic signals. Be it the fact that most of the snitches and snaffles occur at these divine locations, or for the time & money we do not have to succour to the never ending strings of the less privileged, or simply for that we are all just a concentrated bunch of colour blind individuals for whom these three colour indicating poles (usually working) mean as much as nothing. Pick any of the lot and more, you just can not augment the Discipline our Quaid wanted very, very, very much in us.

Just a few minutes later, oh, did I mention I woke up pretty early (by which of course I meant I woke up past noon because national holiday bhuii), we went for the Jumma prayers. On the way out there were a bunch of people being kicked away by our competent police authorities simply for letting a word out of their parched tongues, the bunch any of us would normally call beggars. So much for the freedom of speech, let alone the freedom to live. 

That is pretty much all the sunlight I saw today, since a flicker more would make my complexion go 0.01 % darker; and God, will the society ever accept me?

Just by the way, there were scads of green fluorescent laid on main Shahr-e-Faisal; PCB is spending a fair amount on PSL this year.","‚ÄúWith life as short as a half-taken breadth, do not plant anything but love.‚Äù ‚Äì Rumi.

Not all of us get equal odds at life; yet, all of us get an equal life. You see, life never was about one‚Äôs time served on this secular land, it always was about one making sense of that stretch. I suspect, the ones who assessed the veracity of it, got called upon by God for the sake that this bout, that is life, remained only just. 

I gaze around at the aura, sensing all the murk it possesses, an obvious reflection of a child‚Äôs worst nightmares. I see pristine souls leave the face of earth before they got a thorough chance at spelling the word ‚Äòlife‚Äô; merely, because they were too immersed assembling words of the likes of empathy, justice and compassion, and had just enough left in them to call life all but a rendezvous.

They say they never discovered another Rumi; how can you, possibly, unearth something that never was of the earth?

‚ÄúAbsorbed in this world you‚Äôve made it your burden. Rise above this world. There is another vision.‚Äù ‚Äì Rumi.","We woke up today, late, in peace, hurried by absolutely nothing; opened up our facebook walls, and conceived that ... ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs Kashmir Day today ... ‚Äù 
... and then continued on with our everyday lives.

Just a few hundred miles up north-east, an innocent immature soul woke up, agog, looked onto his parents, ensured their presence and bowed down to God in gratitude for they got to live another dawn.

and still, solitude, there was.
#KashmirDay","It‚Äôs amazing how we make sense out of words so opaque, yet fall dupe in the face of the nothings of the language.

In short, almost 95 billion neurons make up the human brain.","eensy fragments of this brain reflect on thinking about ‚Äúchanging the world‚Äù. Somewhere along the way, the world changed us.

- so is the power, such is the hunger, and that is our control over it.","~ waking up today, I thought I‚Äôd seen the sight of the day; climbing back into the warmth of my bed, there was another, more aesthetic warmth that drew my attention. 

Ostensibly, I think we‚Äôre all nothing but very lucky to be persisting till the very day, and such sights are the reason to outlast the entropy ?","If you ask me, people are plain stupid, but then they were supposed to be. If you ask me, people are contagious, but then they were supposed to be. Finally, if you ask me, people are people, but then they weren‚Äôt supposed to be.

If you were to define yourself, considering you‚Äôre the masses *which you are*, would you define it in terms of a word as short, as ugly as ‚Äòpeople‚Äô ?

We‚Äôre meant to be something greater, something extraordinary, and not just ‚Äòpeople‚Äô who start a rant over an english word because they merely, themselves, don‚Äôt like it‚Äôs existence.

~ On that note, I feel shameful and I should probably stop, maybe, you should too ?","times and over have I had a sound debate with people over why the minorities don‚Äôt get days off for their religious festivities, devising only now that those exchange of words were a mere waste since we never really got to a conclusion. 

- Quaid said, ‚ÄúYou are free, free to go to your temples; you are free to go to your mosques ... ‚Äú

Before mosques, he used the term ‚Äòtemples‚Äô, because he knew that the minorities would be left hanging with the state‚Äôs blind eye to attend to. 

- Quaid didn‚Äôt create an ‚ÄúIslamic Republic of Pakistan‚Äù, rather a free and for all ‚ÄúState of Pakistan.‚Äù 

If you go on to read 15 of the most famous quotes by Jinnah, you realize just how much of a secular leader he was, just why he was the leader of the common man, and just why Jinnah was the greatest Muslim of us all.

Then there‚Äôs the talk of justice, where the Muslims of Pakistan get three ‚Äòwhole‚Äô days off for ‚Äòboth‚Äô the Eids ( Alhumdulillah ), what wrong did the Hindus do to have to work their arses off on a sacred day. Christians, the only reason they get off on Christmas is because the Quaid was born on that day, which I‚Äôve always found quite funny in itself.

Maybe, Jinnah knew a ‚Äòdifferent‚Äô Islam or maybe Jinnah knew the only Islam that there ever was.
We follow the Quaid, put his name beside that of this country, exemplify him, then why are we so reluctant to follow him.

‚ÄúWe are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one State‚Äù - THE VERY SAME PERSON.

1) The most important thing for any jury is the innovation in your FYP, the core idea.
If you're doing a research-based project, what is the problem that you're targeting? To what extent has it been solved yet? 
If you're doing a product-based project, what is your target market and what need does your product fulfil? Are there any similar apps/websites available currently on the market? 
Realizing the need for your project is the key to winning a jury. Remember, you may have been thinking about your FYP since your freshman year, but your jury sure has not. Be patient and present facts and figures.

2) The devil is in the details. You should have your basic project plan laid out. The tools, languages, architecture and hardware requirements should have been decided by now.
If you're doing a research-based project, you should have already acquired your dataset. What does your data look like? How many samples does it have? Is it big enough? Is it too big? You should be able to answer all these questions.

3) Know the scope of your project and don't set unrealistic targets. As undergrad students, when we are planning our project, we make the mistake of assuming that our FYP will be the only thing we'll be working on during last year :P You'll have 8 other subjects, 6 of whom would definitely have their own projects and if you were lucky enough to get IPT or any other assignment-driven course, then you'll have even less time to work on your FYP (don't forget the maara-maari of job hunting and interview prep in the last semester).

4) Don't overdo with the Tip # 3. If you're a group of 4 members, the jury would love to hear how each one of you would contribute to the team.

5) Prepare for the question/answer session. Sometimes, they can be brutal. There may be cases where the jury member is not the expert on the technology that you're working on. Be on your toes, bob and weave and don't lose it.

Best of luck and do reach out to your seniors and supervisors in case of any confusion.",,,,,,,,,,

Few days ago I saw a very cute kid fighting for his bag that was cute the way he was aruguing I enjoyed watching it.. Now tv channels are calling him on the show and picking up his items and pushing that innocent kid in a zone where he would fight back for his things we all have seen his reaction there was nothing new this time plz stop irritating that kid you don't know how it could harm him.

This is so beautiful,"Be a Good Listener'

One thing which I observe personally and want to share is that Depression is becoming common these days esp in our generation. Everyone is seemed so busy that no one notices what is happening in their surroundings. 

We are humans, we always need someone to share our happiness, sorrows, good or bad experiences.. We need someone who listen to us by heart without judgement. 

But why do we always expect it from others?? Why couldn't we become a good listener?
Listening to someone is one of the biggest gifts that one can receive.

Listen to others for reasons beyond the selfish gain of it; do it because everyone in this world has a story to tell. Listen to the beauty of people's lives, the way their eyes gleam when they tell you the happiest moment of their lives, the way the tears fall when they do the saddest.

Listen to others because nobody wants to feel alone. Everyone wants to feel as if there is someone in this world who will be willing to listen to them whenever they need.

Go out and, even if for a minute, ask your friends to tell you something that happened to them recently. Tell them something of your own. Do not be afraid to share your own stories as well. 

PS: Whenever you get the chance, just listen to others as it could make huge difference.","After having another year, I am thankful to ALLAH that he has blessed me with so much.

Dear Future Me,

I hope that today you are the person you always set out to be. I hope you accomplished everything that they said you could never do. How many lives do you change in a day? Do you speak out for what is right, or sit there regretting your silence? I hope you are what I'm not. I hope you speak out with such a voice that everyone around you can hear it even when you aren't speaking. I want you to have power in the way you speak- giving light into someone's world filled with darkness. I hope you live as if you are the only one capable of making a difference, and embracing that ability in the best way possible. You don't need to have your name written in the text of a history book, but you need to live to make your words give life to the ones who thought they didn't deserve one.

When you read this letter, I hope you are somewhere where all of you previous goals can be made accomplishments. I hope you still remember your past, and pass on your story to those who need to hear it most- to show them that they are not alone. I hope you achieved that brighter, happier life you used to daydream about when you were younger. I hope all of your dreams became your reality, and I hope that eventually your nightmares dissolved into the depths of your past- never haunting you again. I hope that you one day took off the mask that hid the truth. That you broke down the barriers you built, and learned to trust someone- really trust them- somewhere along your journey. I hope that you look in the mirror with a small, true smile and be proud of what you see. I hope that you learned to break through the surface of the water drowning you- anxiety. I hope that you now see the world from a whole new perspective, and learned to enjoy the sun more than the rain.. Most of all, I hope you learned to speak. To speak in such a voice that must be heard; a voice that embroiders your words onto a heart that needed them most. I hope you are happy, and teach ones who are like the old you to be happy as well. I hope that today you are the person you always set out to be.

Sincerely,
Your Past

-Nikola Tesla, My Inventions-","Here, I give you my blessing again. And just try to remember a few rules of life. Don't say what you're thinking, and don't be too quick to act on what you think. Be friendly to people but don't overdo it. Once you have tested out your friends and found them trustworthy, hold onto them. But don't waste your time shaking hands with every new guy you meet. Don't be quick to pick a fight, but once you're in one, hold your own. Listen to many people, but talk to few. Hear everyone's opinion, but reserve your judgment. Spend all you can afford on clothes, but make sure they're quality, not flashy, since clothes make the man which is doubly true in France. Don't borrow money and don't lend it, since when you lend to a friend, you often lose the friendship as well as the money, and borrowing turns a person into a spendthrift. And, above all, be true to yourself. [To thine own self be true] Then you won't be false to anybody else. Good-bye, son. I hope my blessing will help you absorb what I've said.
